## About
This is a quick demo which lazy-loads all images from the [Dog API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/).

This app uses the following libraries besides the usual libraries that comes with `create-react-app`:

* [react-virtualized](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized) for efficiently render images and for masonry support.
* [request-image-size](https://github.com/FdezRomero/request-image-size) for requesting image sizes that are required to display the masonry component correctly.
